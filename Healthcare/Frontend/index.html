        <p>
          For close to a hundred years now the HealthCare name has been synonymous
          with Trust. Trust that has been won and retained by successive
          generations of Peerless people, who have made it their Mission to give
          back to the Society more than what it draws from it for sustenance. To
          us, HealthCare is much more than a mere name, it is a way of life, it what
          we strive to be, in everything we do, at all points in time. Being
          HealthCare is a means to an end, not the end in itself.<br><br> The 400 bed
          Multi-Specialty HealthCare Hospital is build
          around this core principle of Selfless, Single-minded and Sustainable
          Service. A pioneering status in the healthcare domain in the Eastern
          parts of India with what was, and continues to be, a world class
          facility backed by some of the most acclaimed medical practitioners in
          their respective fields of excellence and a clinic of caregivers who
          raises the bar of nursing on a daily basis, HealthCare continues to set
          goals in excellence only to surpass them. As a matter of fact, in the
          last year and a half itself, the Hospital has gone through a major inter
          functional and multidimensional revamp process, aimed at ensuring that
          its infrastructure remain cutting edge.
          <br><br>
          The Emergency Section, which often marks the difference between life and death, has been equipped with a dedicated operation theatre, is manned by emergency consultants on a 24 X 7 basis; is backed by a new fleet of ambulances and necessary life saving infrastructural facilities. This has resulted in a substantial reduction in the response time in this 19 bed amenity, increasing the success rate of critical care manifold.
          <br><br>
          The Thalassaemia Clinic has been refurbished with HPLC and is now able to offer organ specific iron overload detection facilities with the installation of a 1.5T MRI. The attached Blood Bank too has been upgraded to move beyond the mere storing of blood and is now capable of offering blood components like fresh / frozen plasma, packed cells and platelets – all vital inputs in the fight against the dreaded disease.
          <br><br>
          The Central Sterile Supply Department (CSSD), the kernel from which springs the sapling of freedom against germs and differentiates a truly great hospital from the others has also been upgraded to global standards with the introduction of a number of key equipments and the adoption of acknowledged best practices.

            I am writing to express my gratitude from my family for the care given to my mother. In the SICU, there was care, compassion, and respect. A special thank you to your social workers as well; they provided professional guidance, comfort, and strength to make our own decisions.  They were patient and helpful. All our hope that you continue along this path.          </p>

            We would like to let you know how much we appreciate the special care our daughter was given by the doctors and staff at your hospital. Our baby’s physician was professional, kind, understanding, and her treatment was “right on.” Your organization should be proud to have such kind hearted people. They made sure that my daughter’s hospitalization was very pleasant.          </p>
